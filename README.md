# DSTFuse
**Abstract**
Infrared and visible image fusion aims at obtaining fused images that keep advantages of source images, e.g., detailed textures and clear edge structures. To tackle the challenge in modeling features from visible image under motion blur and low light conditions, we propose a novel fusion framework, DSTFuse, which aims to leverage infrared image as the style image and enable it to perform style transfer on the visible image to efficiently eliminate motion blur. Specifically, DSTFuse contains a Cross-Modality Style Transfer Module (CST-module) that collect appropriate style information from the infrared image and guide the transformation of blurry objects into the corresponding style while preserve all other elements without alteration. The output of CST-module is integrated with the image with a multitude of visible features from another module and mapped into final image. Extensive experiments show that DSTFuse achieves promising results in infrared-visible image fusion task. And it is also shown that DSTFuse can boost the performance in downstream infrared-visible object detection.
